# Enhance Your Firefox Experience ðŸ”¥ðŸ¦Š
Essential tweaks, settings, and tools to optimize Firefox for usability, privacy, and customization.
## Install Firefox
Visit the [Firefox Website](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and hit the big blue download button.

### Using CLI (Recommended)
#### Windows
If you're on Windows, you can use [Winget](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh4nns1?hl=en-us&gl=IN):
```bash
winget install Mozilla.Firefox
```

#### Mac OS
On mac you can install Firefox using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash 
brew install --cask firefox
```

#### Linux
Firefox might already be preinstalled on your Linux distro. It's also available as a [Flatpak package](https://flathub.org/apps/org.mozilla.firefox):
```bash 
flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.firefox
```

## Setting everything up with User.js
With a `user.js` file, you don't need to set up everything manually. Simply place the `user.js` file containing your settings into the Firefox root directory, restart Firefox, and all configurations will be applied automatically.

[Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) is one of the most popular and well-configured `user.js` files. I recommend using my modified user.js file, as it is built upon the solid Betterfox foundation, offering additional tweaks such as improved font rendering on Windows, HTTPS-Only mode, disabled WebRTC, and more.

### Steps
1. Download the `user.js` file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wixlogo/firefox-mustdo/refs/heads/main/user.js) (Right click > `Save Link Asâ€¦`).

2. Go to `about:profiles` in Firefox. Under **Root Directory**, click `Open Folder`.

3. Paste the downloaded `user.js` file into the folder.

4. Restart Firefox (Just close and open it again), and it should look like this:

- [Black by XI](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/black21/) is my favorite theme. It offers a pure black design.

- You can also use [Firefox Color](https://color.firefox.com/) which is an [addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firefox-color/) developed by Firefox team themselves which lets you create your own theme.
- Customize Firefox using CSS! You can make Firefox look like Chrome with [Material Fox Updated](https://github.com/edelvarden/material-fox-updated) or even the trending ARC browser with [Arc UI](https://github.com/dxdotdev/arc-ui). Check out these resources to know about Firefox-CSS:
