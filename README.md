## Install Firefox
Visit the [Firefox Website](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and hit the big blue download button.

### Using CLI (Recommended)
#### Windows
If you're on Windows, you can choose from multiple package managers:

1. **[Winget](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh4nns1?hl=en-us&gl=IN)** (Pre-installed on Windows 10/11):  
   ```bash
   winget install Mozilla.Firefox
   ```

2. **[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)**:  
   ```bash
   scoop install firefox
   ```

3. **[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)**:  
   ```bash
   choco install firefox
   ```
   
#### Mac OS
Install Firefox using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash 
brew install --cask firefox
```

#### Linux
Firefox might already be preinstalled on your Linux distro. If not, run these commands according to your linux distro:

1. **Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions**:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt install firefox
   ```

2. **Fedora/Red Hat-based distributions**:  
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install firefox
   ```

3. **Manjaro/Arch-based distributions**:  
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S firefox
   ```

4. **Flatpak (Universal Package Manager)**:   
   ```bash
   flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.firefox
   ```

  > **Note:** Firefox native packages (from your distro's repository) tend to be faster and more stable compared to Flatpak. However, Flatpak applications include sandboxing and isolation with the OS out of the box, offering additional security.  
>  
> For optimal protection even with native packages, I highly recommend taking the time to learn and configure [AppArmor](https://ubuntu.com/security/apparmor) or [SELinux](https://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page) based on your Linux distribution.  
> Properly configuring a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system can provide robust protection even for native packages by limiting application privileges and preventing unauthorized access.

## Setting everything up with User.js
With a `user.js` file, you don't need to set up everything manually. Simply place the `user.js` file containing your settings into the Firefox root directory, restart Firefox, and all configurations will be applied automatically.

[Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) is one of the most popular and well-configured `user.js` files. I recommend using my modified `user.js` file, as it is built upon the solid Betterfox foundation, offering additional [tweaks](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Common-Overrides) and [hardening](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Optional-Hardening) which include:

| Enforce DNS-over-HTTPS                          | `network.trr.mode`, `3`                           | Guarantees encrypted DNS queries for better security and anonymity.       |
| Ask where to save every file                    | `browser.download.useDownloadDir`, `false`        | Gives users control over storage location and prevents accidental downloads of malicious or unintended files. |

2. Go to `about:profiles` in Firefox. Under **Root Directory**, click `Open Folder`.
